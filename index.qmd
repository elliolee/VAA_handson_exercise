About This Site

Welcome to my course portfolio for ISSS608 Visual Analytics & Applications at Singapore Management University.

This website documents my learning journey in visual analytics — from fundamental graphical principles to advanced analytical storytelling using R and interactive visualization tools.

Throughout this course, I focus on transforming raw data into interpretable insights through:

-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Statistical graphics design

-   Interactive visualisation

-   Analytical narrative construction

-   Reproducible workflows in R & Quarto
